# My Hybrid Transformer-State Space Model for Quantitative Trading
THIS IS A WIP AND DOES NOT CURRENTLY RUN

# Project Overview
I'm developing a novel hybrid architecture that combines state space models with transformer attention mechanisms for financial market prediction. My model aims to capture both continuous market dynamics through its state space component and long-range dependencies through its attention mechanism.

# Core Components
# Model Architecture
I've implemented a hybrid model consisting of:
python class HybridFinancialModel(nn.Module):
    - State space component for tracking continuous market dynamics
    - Transformer attention for identifying relevant historical patterns
    - Bidirectional coupling between state and memory components
    - Multiple prediction heads for direction, magnitude, and uncertainty

# Data Infrastructure
I've built a comprehensive data handling system:
pythonclass FinancialDataHandler:
    - Market data loading and preprocessing
    - Feature calculation including:
        - Technical indicators
        - Market regime indicators
        - Liquidity metrics
        - Correlation structure analysis

# Training Framework
I've developed a training framework that:
pythonclass ModelTrainer:
    - Handles data preparation and batching
    - Implements training loop with validation
    - Manages model optimization

# Key Features

Adaptive Dynamics: I've designed state transition matrices conditioned on memory state
Multi-scale Processing: I've combined short-term dynamics with long-term pattern recognition
Risk-Aware: I've included uncertainty estimation in predictions
Market Regime Awareness: I've explicitly modeled different market conditions


# Current Status
I have:

Implemented the base architecture
Established the data pipeline
Set up the training framework
Created initial testing framework


#  Next Steps
I plan to:

Debug and get to run again
Conduct thorough backtesting
Implement paper trading system
Optimize hyperparameters
Add additional risk management features
Develop monitoring and reporting systems


# Performance Goals
I'm aiming for:

Sharpe Ratio: > 1.5
Maximum Drawdown: < 15%
Low correlation with major market indices


# Dependencies
I'm using:

PyTorch
yfinance
pandas
numpy


# Usage
Here's how I use my model:
pythonmodel = HybridFinancialModel(
    state_dim=32,
    memory_dim=64,
    input_dim=20,
    num_heads=4
)

trainer = ModelTrainer(
    model=model,
    training_start='2010-01-01',
    training_end='2022-12-31'
)

trainer.train_model(
    epochs=100,
    learning_rate=1e-4
)


# Potential Applications
I see several potential applications:

Personal trading
Fund strategy development
Risk management system
Market regime detection


# Notes
I'm currently:

In development phase
Conducting further validation and testing
Recommending paper trading before live deployment
